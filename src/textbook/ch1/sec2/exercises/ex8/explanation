to use Quadratic.java to find the square root of a number, since the program solves the following equation:
x^2 + bx + c = 0
by taking cli arguments for b and c, all we need to do is execute the program with the first cli argument passed to
the program being 0, which will be the b, and the other one -n, where n is the positive number we want to find the
square root of, which will be the c in our quadratic equation;
this is because x^2 + bx + c = 0, so x^2 + bx = -c; if we set b = 0 then we get x^2 = -c, but -c has to be >= 0, so c <= 0
ex:
java Quadratic 0 -4
